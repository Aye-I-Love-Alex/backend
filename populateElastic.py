There have also been seven American presidents from Ohio: Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding. Ohio is important in elections because it is a swing state. Candidates often campaign a lot there and prior to 2020, the last time they voted for the losing candidate was 1960. Also, no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying this state. Ohio has both farmland and cities, and there is a lot of discrimination against black people.[13] It is a part of the Midwest. Ohio is the 7th most populated state in the United States of America.",

Many Germans settled in the city and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood gets its name from the river in Germany. Soap and machine tools are major industries in the area, which is home to the company Procter & Gamble as well as Macy's. Cincinnati's economy and population declined in the late 1900s, but the city is on the upswing. The Over-The-Rhine neighborhood has seen a lot of new businesses and development in recent years.",
