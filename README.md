### Running ElasticSearch:
If running for first time:
1. Download ElasticSearch [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/getting-started.html#run-elasticsearch) and Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Follow self-managed commands to initially run ElasticSearch for Docker [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/getting-started.html#run-elasticsearch)
3. Run command to build mapping for ElasticSearch (found commented out in `populateElastic.py`)
4. Add a folder named "graph" in the same directory as the other program files, such as comparator.py and Connection.py. This is where the graphs will be stored after running.

If ElasticSearch has been run in the past:
1. Open Docker Desktop and run container for ElasticSearch
